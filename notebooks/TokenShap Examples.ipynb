      "The sky appears blue because of a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering, named after the British physicist Lord Rayleigh, who first described it in the late 19th century.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's what happens:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere**: When sunlight enters our atmosphere, it encounters tiny molecules of gases such as nitrogen (N2) and oxygen (O2).\n",
      "2. **Scattering occurs**: These gas molecules scatter the light in all directions, but they scatter shorter (blue) wavelengths more than longer (red) wavelengths.\n",
      "3. **Blue light is scattered**: The blue light is scattered in all directions by the tiny gas molecules, while the longer wavelengths of light (like red and orange) continue to travel in a straight line.\n",
      "4. **Our eyes see the scattered blue light**: As we look up at the sky, our eyes see the blue light that has been scattered in all directions by the gas molecules.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is why the sky appears blue during the daytime, especially when the sun is overhead and the air is free of pollution. The color of the sky can also change depending on various factors such as:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Time of day**: During sunrise and sunset, the light travels through more of the Earth's atmosphere, scattering off even more particles and bending the shorter wavelengths (like blue and violet) out of the direct line of sight.\n",
      "* **Atmospheric conditions**: Dust, pollution, and water vapor in the air can scatter light differently, affecting the apparent color of the sky.\n",
      "* **Clouds and fog**: Clouds and fog can absorb or scatter light, changing the appearance of the sky.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, to summarize: the sky appears blue because of Rayleigh scattering, where tiny gas molecules scatter shorter wavelengths (like blue) more than longer wavelengths (like red), making blue the dominant color we see.\n"
